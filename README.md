This is a simple discord bot -- it responds to known prompts with a specified message
(e.g. when someone says "hello" respond with "Hello there!").

The prompts and responses can be configured from a web app.

It is powered by Convex via a webhook from Discord.

It assumes that a Discord bot with the slash command `/ask_convex` has already been
set up.
